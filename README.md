# OverBot.js
Welcome to the best (maybe) overwatch stat tracker for discord !!!

To launch it, install node.js, and start the bot with the command : node LOCATION_OF_THE_BOT\OverBot.js YOUR_BOT_TOKEN

Have fun !!

Commands :
OwStat Player#1234 = Send embed with player stats.
OverBot shutdown = Shutdown the bot.

If you want to add something, tell me. 

P.S: actually there is a lot of overwatch bot on the fantastic world of internet, so help me to make this bot better than the others !!
