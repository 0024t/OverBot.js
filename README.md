# OverBot.js
Welcome to the best (maybe) overwatch stat tracker for discord !!!

# How to install

First install node.js.
Then, run setup.bat. It will download and install depencies, you must wait.
Then type in your bot token as asked.
Now you can run the bot by using run.bat

Finally, go to http://localhost:8080/rest/index and start the bot !! (or stop it lol).

NEVER CLOSE THE COMMAND PROMPT MANUALLY ( You can try but be ready ) !!

Have fun !!

# Commands

-OwStat Player#1234 = Send embed with player stats.

-OverBot shutdown = Shutdown the bot.


If you want to add something, tell me. 

P.S: actually there is a lot of overwatch bot on internet, so help me to make this bot better !!
